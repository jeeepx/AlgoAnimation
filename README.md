# Longest Increasing Subsequence Animations
This repository contains a collection of animations designed to helps the student visualize the longest increasing subsequence problem. The animations provide an overview of the three primary methods for solving this problem: Naive Recursion Enumeration, Backtracking, and Dynamic Programming. They were created using the [Manim animation engine](https://www.manim.community/). [ Here](https://youtu.be/buB-VifgeNE) is the YouTube video with explanation for this animation.

## Installations
1. [Install Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)
2. Run  ```manim -pql fileName.py className```. 
<br>To change the quality of the video, [change the flag](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/output_and_config.html#:~:text=The%20%2Dql%20flag%20(for%20low%20quality)%20has%20been%20replaced%20by%20the%20%2Dqh%20flag%2C%20for%20high%20quality.%20Manim%20will%20take%20considerably%20longer%20to%20render%20this%20file%2C%20and%20it%20will%20play%20it%20once%20it%E2%80%99s%20done%20since%20we%20are%20using%20the%20%2Dp%20flag.%20The%20output%20should%20look%20like%20this).
3. The animations are saved to the same directory under media/videos.

### Example 
To run the Naive Recusion Enumeration scene, run ```manim -pql LcsNaiveRecursion.py CreateLCSTree``` <br>
